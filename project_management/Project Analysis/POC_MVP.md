## MVP and POC analysis

---

## I. POC

It is widely known that software designed for finding text on pictures (or movie frames) is possible and has already more than a couple of examples spread around the world.

The same story is about character recognition, parsing found text and present it to the user as a live service.

Thus it is not needed to build a proof of concept for such software. The proof is already delivered by companies like Google.

## II. Desirable product and MVP

The desirable product would be a mobile device software which with use of mobile camera can live recognize nordic runes (specifically from filmed TV screen) and deliver parsed text in place of recognized runes.

MVP for such product would be simple web app returning a text parsed from recognition on user uploaded image.
