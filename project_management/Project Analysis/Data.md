## Data

---

It is assumed the rune dataset as the most significant base input for ML pipeline is the hardest to organize in the project.

There is no available nordic rune dataset representing desired range of cases, as well as any nordic rune dataset. It is needed to collect such data for the sake of the project.

The data will be collected systematically, with small iterations based on actual needs. This approach gives the flexibility that will be needed in one-man team.
